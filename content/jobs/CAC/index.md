- Developing automated AWS cloud HPC cluster for climate simulations using WRF, Kubernetes, and Terraform
- Accelerating simulations 5x by scaling to 500+ cores on demand, reducing typical WRF run times from weeks to days.
- Automated end-to-end workflows for cluster deployment, job execution, and S3 data storage using Pulumi and Singularity containers with MPI, enabling cost-optimized execution of WRF climate simulations in the cloud
